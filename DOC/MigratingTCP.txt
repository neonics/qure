Migrating TCP Connections
=========================
* (see [NetFork])

Nodes in a local cluster may want to function as more than backups
that step in when the DMZ node becomes unavailable.

One specific functionality would be a distribution of content, whereby
load is balanced according to storage groups limiting potential access
times and providing for individual threads of development.

The term development also refers to the step of deploying and thus
updating websites, which is part of the development process. The effect
of deploying a website translates to a particular dataset being updated.
Such datasets might want to be distributed among several, but not all,
nodes. The decision for partial distribution can be made according to
the criterium that partial datasets must be complete within each node.
The level at which such data is split into a parallel set is, however,
not specified, which allows to distribute a single large file among
several nodes, each defining a dataset as a consecutive address sequence.

HTTP based requests are established over a TCP connection, a popularly
unfortunate combination. Migrating a connection is not supported in HTTP.
Redirects are, and this can be used by the DMZ node to return a different
location. Consider virtual HTTP hosts. A website may be requested from
the DMZ node. It looks up the node serving it in it's database, and
constructs an address that indicates both the node and the website.
For example, ''http://www.example.com/'' might be requested; the resulting
address might be ''http://www.example.com.qure-2.cloud/''.

When the node is public, meaning that it is not part of the local cluster,
returning the redirect would suffice. Ofcourse, the chance would be extremely
small, if the cluster DNS services are used, that such a request would
be resolved to a cluster that does not host the requested website. It might
happen that the local nodes hosting the site may be unavailable.

When the website is known to be hosted by a local cluster node, the redirect
will not solve the issue, for, the node's address will resolve to the DMZ
node once more, presenting the problem again. Therefore, such redirects
will not be sent publically for local nodes, as they are designed to operate
in a unique IP context. Since the node's address will resolve to the same IP,
the purpose of the redirect is defeated.

The HTTP code keeps buffering input data until the request is complete.
In the case where manual service communication is attempted, packets
are often sent on line boundaries (such as ''cat | nc''). HTTP diverges
from the underlying TCP specification by introducing a duplication of
the ''TCP PSH'' flag functionality, indicating that the data sent is
complete in order for the server to take a next step, which, in the case
of HTTP services, is to determine whether it can handle the request.

Luckily, TCP sequences are based on payload size only, and therefore,
multiple packets can be aggregated and sent in a different number of packets.
Thus, it is possible to notify another local node that a TCP connection
is being transferred to it and send it the cached payload. This constitutes
a replay of the connection so far that is functionally identical but might
be different in form.

Example:

	Client (nonlocal IP)			Server (DMZ ip)
	TCP SYN			
						TCP SYN, ACK 1, SEQ 1
	TCP ACK 1,SEQ 1,      "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n"
						TCP ACK 17, SEQ 1
	TCP ACK 1,SEQ 17, PSH "Host: www\r\n\r\n"
						TCP ACK 30, SEQ 1

At this point, 3 packets have been sent, and the 3rd packet sent by the client
contains both the ''TCP PSH'' flag and the end-of-HTTP-request ''\r\n\r\n''
marker.

The node, now having determined the ''Host'' for the request and looked up
the cluster node hosting the site, begins the transfer of the TCP connection.

For this, we introduce a custom TCP option indicating the setup of a redirected
connection. In the initial stages, the redirecting node must use it's own IP
address, otherwise the node redirected to will send TCP responses publically.

The redirecting node (the DMZ node) will not have kept track of all the TCP
packets being communicated as it operates on a streaming socket. It only
has the payload sent to it so far, and thus also the last ACK number.

The communication begins as follows:


	Redirecting DMZ Node			Target node
	TCP SYN opt=REDIRECT:Client_IP
						TCP SYN, ACK 1
	TCP ACK 1, PSH "GET /.....\r\n\r\n"
						TCP ACK 30
