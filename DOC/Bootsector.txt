= ISO9660 Image Booting =

* Floppy Emulation

	genisoimage -b IMAGE

	This argument is required for all ISO9660 image booting.
	If the image size equals a traditional floppy disk,
	i.e. 144*10240, floppy emulation is used.

	The bootdevice (register dx) is 0, the first floppy. Any real
	floppy drives present are shifted.

* No Emulation

	genisoimage -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size SECTORS

	No emulation. Able to specify a number of sectors to be loaded
	by the BIOS. The entire boot image is stored on disk, even
	if it is larger than the number of sectors.

	The bootdevice is E0, however, the specification says
	it will be between 81 and FF. However, the harddisks
	are also shifted forward...
	If there is one harddisk present, 81 indicates the cd.
	If there are two harddisks present, 81 may indicate
	the second harddisk, or the disk image. 80 then can
	indicate the first harddisk, or the image.

* HDD Emulation

	Not tested.


A bootloader that would work regardless, would not rely on BIOS,
or the ISO format, to have the boot image stored succeeding the first sector.

On an ISO image we can safely assume that the image is contiguous,
and access it using the BIOS and the drive identifier in register dl.

On a harddisk, the sectors after sector 0 are undefined. The partition
table present in the bootsector (which is then called MBR), indicates
the disk format.

Thus, to be able to use one universal bootloader for booting from
CD, floppy, or existing disk, we can only rely on 440 bytes of
code and 70 bytes partition information.

The partition table for a harddisk is able to reserve space,
and if installing on an empty HDD we can then use this function
to reserve space for the boot image before the partitions.

Since the BIOS only provides automatic loading of more than one sector
in a no-emulation el-torito CD image, we cannot rely on this feature
in case the boot device is a floppy or a harddisk (or USB, NIC etc..)


= Segmentation =

First attempt then is to have the bootloader code load the succeeding
sectors.

The bootsector should know the size of the entire boot image.

This can be done by having one source file, bootloader.S,
which defines a label equalling the number of sectors.
Also this allows to use the same address space for the entire image.

A second sourcefile may define itself as at origin 512.
They cannot then be included, if the second uses GNU AS, and
uses .text and .data, as data from the second sector will end up
in the first sector.

It is then required to have both the code and the data present
in the first sector. This can be done in various ways:
* using only .text in the first sector
* disallowing using .data in succeeding sectors.
* using only .text throughout, using subsections.

The solution chosen is to implement the bootsector using only .text,
which limits the restrictions to only the first 440 bytes.

= Loading succeeding sectors =

Assuming that the entire image has been constructed to use the same
address space, i.e. is contiguous, and code any sector can correctly
reference any other sector.

Assuming further, for the first attempt, that the image itself
is contiguous on disk, including it's first sector.

The code then is a simple loop to load a number of sectors,
incrementing the load address, or, trusting the BIOS to load multiple
sectors at once.

* Loading contiguous block anywhere on the boot medium

* Loading contiguous block anywhere

* Loading filesystem specific, possibly discontinuous block

Limitation: BIOS can have limited capacity to address storage.


== Contiguous kernel storage ==

DOS implements this by having it's tools enforce a contiguous storage
of system files (IO.SYS etc) within the fragmentable filesystem.
Since the FAT filesystem is relatively simple, finding a disk address
for a file is very straightforward.

Linux implements this by having a reserved disk area within it's filesystems
where all files are (i suppose) written consecutively.

The IBM partitioning scheme for harddisks allows for reserved sectors
to follow the bootsector, however, there is no consensus as to it's
format, and thus, different OS's on other partitions may assume it's
space for it's own use. 

We may assume that the bootloader is stored on a particular partition,
in which case it determines the start of the filesystem and thus can
reserve the data for itself. FAT for instance specifies where it's
descriptor sectors are stored, which offer the possibility of reserving
space outside of the filesystem. 

Since the bootloader is too small to implement finding out the address
for a particular file in all filesystems, we do rely on this contiguous
storage for the stage 1 bootloader - sector1.

=== Floppy Bootsector ===
set stack top to 7c00

Uses INT 1E vector (0000:0078) floppy drive parameters,
updates it and calls another bios int.

Uses data in sector to seek root of filesystem for kernel - io.sys etc.
loads it, and executes it.

terminates with int 19 when unsuccesful

=== Hard Disk Bootsector ===

Relocates itself to 0000:0600.

contains primary partition table; scans itself to see if there is
an active/bootable partition. If so, loads the first sector of
the partition at 0000:7c00 and executes that.


== Modular Kernel ==

To have a configurable, extensible kernel, we will need to be able to 
have a filesystem space where these settings can be configured, and modules
stored.

As such the division of sector1 bootstrapping the core kernel image,
is no longer necessary, as both are static, contiguous blocks.
Simply appending this core kernel to the stage 1 bootloader 'sector1'
removes the need for code to do anoter dereference.

However, the bootloader is made as universal as possible, and thus,
can be the MBR, or a partition bootsector. It is possible to have
several kernels on different partitions, which would then duplicate
this stage1 loader on different partitions, each having their own
different kernel embedded in them.

Further, when the core kernel image itself is to be configurable,
having the bootloader code stable, it is convenient to have this
deference.

It does require however that the filesystem of this shared space is
programmed into sector1, and thus, operating system specific code
would be present there.

= Relocation =

The bootloader should automatically relocate itself if it is the MBR.
It can then chainload the bootloader from a particular partition.

Since this chainloaded bootloader does not know where it was loaded from,
it needs to encode this within it's own structure. As we cannot know which
filesystems may be used, we just stick with the MBR, even in Volume
Boot Sectors (partition boot sectors).
