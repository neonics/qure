         I/O Ports and Controllers on IBM Compatibles and PS/2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following gives the input and output ports used by IBM PC compatible
computers.  Most ports allow access to input and output device
controllers.  A controller may have several internal registers which can
be set to fix the operation of that controller, read its status, or send
data to it.  Other ports access discrete logic latches or registers.
Some ports are write-only or read-only.  It is even possible for a port
to be write-only and read-only by using two different registers at the
same port address.  Port addresses can range from 0 to 0FFFFH (64K
ports). However, PC system boards generally reserve only the first 1024
(0-3FFH). The AT and PS/2 freely employ ports above 3FFH for extended
applications, such as the two port asynchronous adaptors and network
adaptors.

Ports from 0-0FFH have a special significance, since the 80x86 can use
byte rather than word port addresses in the IN and OUT instructions.

Ports 00-0FH and 81H-83H: The 8237A DMA Controller Chip and PS/2 Extensions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 8237A chip controls direct memory access (DMA) to and from a set of
16 ports from 000H to 00FH.  There are three DMA channels available. DMA
is performed by stealing a CPU bus cycle, setting a wait state if
necessary, to transfer each byte.  Ports 081H to 083H are DMA page
register ports for DMA channel 1-3.  Amoung the 20 bits for memory
addressing during DMA transfer, the first four bits are the output of
the page register.  The last 16 bits are output from the 8237A.

On an IBM PC compatible, channel 0 is used by the hardware to refresh
dynamic RAM.  This channel is not available to software.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ports 20H-21H: Master 8259A Interrupt Controller
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first 8259A occupies two port addresses at 020H-021H from which four
initialization command word registers and three operation command word
registers are set. Three interrupt status registers can be read.
The 8259A can be used to generate INTR 80x86 type interrupts from a
hardware device.  Moreover, several 8259As can be chained together.  The
ATs and PS/2s use a second slave 8259A.

The 8259A has three one-byte registers to control and monitor eight
hardware interrupt lines IRx.  A bit in the interrupt-request-register
(IRR) is set when an interrupt request line becomes active.  The
in-service-register (ISR) is checked to see if another interrupt is in
progress.  Also, the priority of the interrupts is checked.  Then, the
interrupt-mask-register (IMR) is used to verify if the interrupt is
allowed.  The IMR can be programmed to mask interrupts by setting the
corresponding bits and sending the byte to the second controller port.
After a hardware interrupt service routine is finished, the controller
interrupts must be re-enabled by sending 20H to the first controller
port.

   On IBM PC machines, the 8259A is set to respond to positive-going
edges on the interrupt request lines (IRQ0-IRQ7), to use interrupt
vectors 08-0FH, to use buffered mode, and to re-initialize interrupts
upon receipt of 020H (end-of-interrupt) code on port 20H.  Configuration
can be performed using:

   MOV AL,13H      ; edge-triggered, one 8259a, icw4 needed
   OUT 20H,AL
   MOV AL,8        ; use interrupt vectors 08-0fh for IR0-IR7
   OUT 21H,AL
   MOV AL,9        ; icw4 buffered mode, normal eoi, 8086 CPU
   OUT 21H,AL

To enable BIOS interrupt routines, use mask 0bch (0 bit means enable):

   MOV AL,0BCH     ; enable disk (bit 6), keyboard (bit 1), timer (bit 0)
   OUT 21H,AL
   STI

   MOV AL,20H      ; eoi command
   OUT 20H,AL

The IRQn lines are set to CPU interrupt service by the master and slave
interrupt controllers in the following order:

Hardware Interrupts                          Software Service Routine

  IRQ0 Timer every 0.054897095 seconds          INT  8H

  IRQ4 Serial device COM1                         INT 0CH

General programming considerations:

General initialization sequence (* for IBM PC):

1. Send initialization command "word" (ICW1) to port 20H as byte:

   bit     description

   7-5     A7-A5 vector address table for 8080 or 8085 sytem
         * 000 if 8086 system
    4    * 1  ICW1 identifier bit
    3    * 0= edge sensitive interrupt
           1= level sensitive interrupt
    2      0= eight byte vector addresses in interrupt table
         * 1= four byte vector addresses in interrupt table (IBM)
    1      0= Several 8259A chips in system (cascade mode, ICW3 needed)
         * 1= only one 8259A chip in system (no slaves, no ICW3 needed)
    0      0= ICW4 not needed
         * 1= ICW4 to be sent

2. Send ICW2 to port 21H as byte:

    bit    description

     7-3   A15-A11 if 8080/85 system,
         * A7-A3 vector address if 8086 system
     0-2   A10-A8 if 8080/85 system
         * 000 if 8086 system

3. If ICW1 bit 1=0, send ICW3 to 21H as mask to show which IRn lines have
   slave 8259As.  If this 8259A is a slave, use bits 0-3 to set value
   of master IRn to which this slave is attached.

4. Send ICW4 to port 21H as byte:

    bit    description

    7-5    not used, set 0
     4   * 0= serve interrupts sequentially
           1= priority nested order: IR0 > IR1 > ... IR7
     3     0= non-buffered mode, ignore bit 2
         * 1= buffered mode selected, check bit 2 and use SP/EN line
     2   * 0= slave if bit 3=1
           1= master controller if bit 3=1
     1   * 0= not automatic end-of-interrupt (must send eoi=20h to 21h)
           1= automatic end-of-interrupt
     0     0=8080/8085 mode
         * 1=8086 mode

Commands:  The following operation command "words" can be sent to the
8259A (in any order, as needed), by out commands to port 20H and 21H:

Operation Command "Word" 1: Mask for IR0-IR7 (reset bit to 0 to enable
interrupt); send to 21H.


Operation Command "Word" 2 to port 20H:

    bit    description

     7     0= no rotation of interrupt priority
           1= rotate interrupt priority according to:
              bits 6 5 = 1 1 current IRn (bits 2-0) set to lowest priority
                         0 1 ignore bits 2-0
                         0 0 no EOI command will be issued
     6     0= disable bits 0-2
           1= enable bits 0-2
     5     0= do not issue EOI command to CPU
           1= issue EOI to CPU
    4-3    0 0  OCW2 identifier
    2-0    index of IRn for this command

Operation Command "Word" 3 to port 20H:

    bit    description

     7     not used
     6     0= ignore bit 5
           1= honor bit 5
     5     0= disable special mask mode
           1= enable special mask mode
    4-3    0 1 OCW3 identifier
     2     0= poll command has not been issued
           1= override bit 1 and poll command has been issued
     1     0= no read register command issued
           1= read register command issued
     0     0= interrupt-request register will be read by read-status operation
           1= in-service register will be read by read-status operation

Interrupt status read:

  in al,021h    ; gives contents of interrupt-mask register
  mov ah,al
  in al,020h    ; gives contents of in-service register or
                ;  interrupt-request register, according to command
                ;   "word" 3 bit 0

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ports 40H-43H: The 8253 Timer Chip
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ports 44H,47H: PS/2 Watchdog Timer Counter and Control Port
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 8253 is a programmable three-channel 16-bit interval timer/counter,
occupying four ports from 040H to 043H.  Each channel can be used to
take an input clock signal 0-2MHz and produce an output signal by
dividing by an arbitrary 16-bit number.  Channel 0 is used to make the
time-of-day clock ticks, channel 1 is used to tell the DMA to refresh
the dynamic RAM, and channel 2 is used to make a audio signal for the
speaker.  Each channel can be programmed in one of six modes: 0=
interrupt on terminal count, 1= programmable one-shot, 2= rate
generator, 3= square-wave generator, 4= software-triggered strobe, 5=
hardware-triggered strobe.

Initialization:  Send a mode control byte for each channel to the 8253
control word register at 043H.  Send a count to timer port, one byte at
a time.

       for channels 0-2
044H  counter 3
047H  control word register
       for channel 3


Channel 0: The System Timer:

The TOD clock is set by the BIOS to pulse every 18.2 times a second.  On
each pulse, Int 8 is generated.  The Int 8 service routine keeps a tally
at the double word at 40:6Ch.  The channel 0 system timer latch can be
cleared by a system reset, by the Int 8 service, or a write to port 61h
with bit 7=1.  Disk timing operations are also controlled bye this
service.

Channel 1: DMA Refresh Pulses:

The DMA refresh pulse causes the DMA chip to refresh all RAM.  This
channel should not be reprogrammed.

Channel 2: Tone Generation for Speaker:

The Speaker tone timer is connected to the computer speaker. The gate to
this timer are controlled by the 8255 interface chip.  The gate is
closed by sending bit 0 to 1 at port 61H.  The output to the speaker can
be close with bit 5 at port 62H.
An IN instruction at port 43H will place the data buffer in the high-
impedence state with no further operation.  The control word bit pattern
is:

   bits  7-6 Number of channel to program
         5-4 Kind of operation
              00 = move counter value into latch
              01 = read/write high byte only
              10 = read/write low byte only
              11 = read/write high byte, then low byte
         3-1 Mode number (0-5)
           0 If 0, binary data, else BCD

After the control word is sent OUT to port 43H, set channel 2 to enable
clock signal (bit 0) at port 60H.  Use 1 to drive speaker, 0 for timing
operations.  Send counter LSB to 42H, then MSB.

Channel 3: The Watchdog Timer (PS/2 only):

The watchdog timer and system channel time-out are not masked by sending
an 80H to port 70H.  The watchdog timer detects when IRQ0 is active for
more than one clock period.  If so, its counter is decremented.  When
the count reaches 0, a NMI is generated.  Thus, if the IRQ0 is not being
serviced, an error can be detected. When the watchdog timer sets a NMI,
then it also sets I/O 094h bit 4.  NMI stops arbitration until 090h bit
6 = 0.

Ports 60H-63H: PC 8255 Parallel I/O Port Chip for Keyboard and Status
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ports 60H-64H: PS/2 Intel 8042 Keyboard/Auxiliary Device Controller
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 8255 Parallel Port Controller and Programmable Peripheral Interface

The 8255 chips control parallel ports on the PC system, and acts as the
Programmable Peripheral Interface (PPI) for the CPU, occupying four
consecutive port addresses 060H-063H.  The PPI can control three
independent ports (A, B, and C) as either input or output.  The fourth
port address is used as a control port for the chip.  The following
shows the meaning of a control byte sent to the write-only control port:

         bit                        Value      Action

           7   Mode Set Flag          0  Inactive   1  Active
         6,5   Mode Selection A      00  Mode 0    01  Mode 1   1x  Mode 2
           4   Port A                 0  Output     1  Input
           3   Port C (upper 4 bits)  0  Output     1  Input
           2   Mode Selection B       0  Mode 0     1  Mode 1
           1   Port B                 0  Output     1  Input
           0   Port C (lower 4 bits)  0  Output     1  Input

If bit 7 is 0, the byte sent is used to set or reset a bit in port C.
Mode 1 uses three port C lines for handshaking and interrupt control of
port A.  For input, if PC4=0, port A latches data and PC5 goes high to
indicate 'buffer full' for device connected to input lines.  PC5 returns
low when the CPU reads port A.  If port A interrupts are enabled, PC3
also goes high when a byte is received, which can be used for an IRn
line to an 8259A interrupt controller.  Port B functions like port A in
mode 1 except it uses the three low bits of port C for control.  Output
in mode 1 is similar.  Mode 2 allows port A to operated bidirectionally,
with handshaking and interrupt control using five bits of port C.

The PPI Status Ports on the IBM PC compatibles at port addresses 060H to
062H perform the following functions (all set to mode 0, A made input, B
output, C input by sending 099H to 063H):

Example: Direct reading of PC keyboard scan code (replacement for INT 09):

 1. Read scan code.  Note that "make" key scan code has bit 7=1,
    "break" code has bit 7=0, except on AT, for which bit 7 is always 0,
    a "break" produces a 0F0H code, then the key scan code.
 2. Send acknowledge to keyboard by toggling bit 7 to 1, then back to 0.
 3. Put keyboard in buffer.
 4. Signal EOI to the interrupt controller.

The PS/2 8042 Keyboard/Auxiliary Device Controller

On the PS/2, an Intel 8042 chip replaces the 8255, using ports 60H and
64H. Port 61H serves as a system control port for compatibility with the
PC. The 8042 controls both the keyboard and an auxiliary device, such as
a mouse. It receives serial data, check parity, translates keyboard scan
codes, and presents data at the data port 60H.  The interface can
interrupt the system (IRQ1) or can wait for polling.  The I/O port 64H
is the command/status port. A read gives status, a write is interpreted
as a command.  The 8042 provides for a password security mechanism.

A read from port 64H gives the following status byte:

   Bit     Function
    7      1 = Parity error
    6      1 = General Time Out
    5      1 = Auxiliary output buffer full
    4      1 = Inhibit switch
    3      1 = Command/data
    2      1 = System flag
    1      1 = Input buffer full
    0      1 = Output buffer full

The status register can be read at any time.  The data port 60H should
be read only when the output buffer full bit in the status register is
1. Data should be written to the 8042 input buffer only when the input
buffer full bit in the status register is 0.  If the auxiliary output
buffer full bit is 1, then the data read came from the auxiliary device.
The command port 64H should be written to only when the status register
input buffer full bit and the output buffer full bit are 0.  Devices
connected to the 8042 should be disabled before sending a command that
generates output.

The following are recognized commands sent to port 64H:

  20-3FH   Read the 8042 RAM - Bits D5-D0 specify the address.
               Address 0 is the current command byte.

  60-7FH   Write to the 8042 RAM   - Bits D5-D0 specify the address.
               Address 0 will mean the next byte of data out at port 60H
               is the command byte, defined using:

              Bit     Function
               7      Reserved = 0
               6      1 = IBM keyboard translate mode
               5      1 = Disable auxiliary device
               4      1 = Disable keyboard
               3      Reserved = 0
               2      1 = Place system flag in status register
               1      1 = Enable auxiliary interrupt
               0      1 = Enable keyboard interrupt

    A4     Test if password is installed.  Data 0FAH on port 60H means
           that the password is installed, 0F1H means that the password
           is not installed.

    A5     Load Security - initiate the password load procedure.  Following
           this command the 8042 will input from the data port until a
           null is detected.

    A6     Enable Security - enable the security feature, when the password
           pattern is currently loaded.

    A7     Diable auxiliary device interface - set bit 5 of the command
           byte.

    A8     Enable auxiliary device interface - reset bit 5 of the command
           byte.

    A9     Interface test - test the auxiliary device clock and data lines.
           The result is placed in the output buffer at 60H:

              Result      Meaning
                00        No error
                01        Aux. device clock line stuck low
                02        Aux. device clock line stuck high
                03        Aux. device data line stuck low
                04        Aux. device data line stuck high

    AA     Self test - tests 8042.  A 55H is placed in output buffer if
           no errors are detected.

    AB     Interface test - cause the 8042 to test the keyboard clock
           and data lines.  Result reported as in command A9.

    AC     Reserved

    AD     Disable keyboard interface - set bit 4 of the command byte.

    AE     Enable keyboard interface - reset bit 4 of the command byte.

    C0     Read input port - read the 8042 input port and put it in the
           output port.  If bit 3 is 0, the fuse on the +5 Vdc line
           on the system board to the keyboard is open.

    C1     Poll input port low - put port 1 bits 0-3 in status bits 4-7.

    C2     Poll input port high - put port 1 bits 4-7 in status bits 4-7.

    D0     Read output port - put data from output port into the output
           buffer.

    D1     Write output port - put next byte written to 60H into the
           output port.  Caution:  Bit 0 of the output port is connected
           to the System Reset line.  This bit should not be written low.

    D2     Write keyboard output buffer - put next byte written to 60H
           into output buffer and issue device interrupt if enabled.
           This produces a simulated keyboard output.

    D3     Write auxiliary device output buffer - put next byte written
           to 60H input buffer in output buffer as if initiated by the
           auxiliary device and issue interrupt if enabled.

    D4     Write to auxiliary device - transmit next byte written to 60H
           input buffer to auxiliary device.

    E0     Read test inputs - cause the 8042 to read its T0 and T1 inputs.
           This data is placed in the output buffer bits 0 and 1.

  F0-FF    Pulse output port - pulse bits 0-3 of the 8042 output port
           for about 6 usec.  Bits 0 to 3 indicate which bits are to be
           pulsed.  A 0 indicates bit should be pulsed.  Caution:
           Bit 0 of the 8042 output port is connected to the System Reset
           line.  Pulsing this bit resets the system microprocessor.


On the PS/2, the 8042 controller can pass commands to the keyboard
through port 60H:

    ED     Set/reset status indicators. Rresponse is ACK (0FAH), system
           acceptance of ACK requires system to raise clock and data lines
           for at least 500 usec.

    EE     Echo test (valid response is EE)

    EF     Invalid command

    F0     Select alternate scan codes (response is ACK, system then sends
           option byte of 01, 02, or 03, response is ACK)

    F1     Invalid command

    F2     Read keyboard ID (response is ACK plus two ID bytes of 83ABH)

    F3     Set typematic rate/delay (response is ACK, system sends rate/delay
           byte, response is ACK.  The rate/delay byte is:

              bit      function

               7       reserved = 0
              6-5      (delay/250msec - 1)
              4-3      doubling factor of rate
              2-0      (rate/(240/sec) - 8)

    F4     Enable (response is ACK, clears buffer, clears last typematic
           key, and starts scanning).

    F5     Default disable (resets all conditions to power-on state, sends
           ACK, stops scanning).

    F6     Set default (resets to power-on state, sends ACK, sets default
           key types for scan code 3, continues scanning).

  F7-FA    Set all keys to typematic, make/break, make, or typematic/make/
           break for scan code 3 (responds with ACK).

  FB-FD    Set a key type to typematic, make/break, or make (response is
           ACK, then keyboard prepares to receive key scan code from set 3.

    FE     Send the previous output again.

    FF     Reset the keyboard and start internal self-test. Response is
           ACK.  System must acknowledge ACK by raising clock and data lines
           for over 500 usec.  Following acceptance of ACK, keyboard is
           reinitialized and performs a Basic Assurance Test (BAT).  The
           keyboard defaults to scan code 2.


The PS/2 keyboard may send the following codes to the system:

    00     Key detection error/overrun under scan code 2 or 3.

   83AB    Keyboard ID bytes.

    AA     Basic Assurance Test completed.

    FC     Basic Assurance Test failed.

    EE     Echo of EE command.

    FA     ACK code.

    FE     Resend. Invalid input or parity error.

    FF     Key detection error/overrun under scan code 1.

Ports 70H and 71H: Configuration Ports and Real-Time-Clock Chip MC146818
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AT and PS/2 uses port 70H bit 7 to disable 'Non-Maskable' Interrupts
(NMI) by setting bit 7 to 0.  Enable NMI by setting bit 7 to 1.  Note:
the PCs use port 0A0H for this purpose.  Port 70H on ATs is also used to
set a CMOS register index (00-3FH), which is then read from port 71H.
Even when masking the NMI through bit 7 of port 70H, read port 71H
immediately after.  Otherwise, the RTC may be left in an unknown state.
The watchdog timer and system channel time-out are not masked by sending
an 80H to port 70H.

The AT stores configuration settings on a Motorola MC146818 real time-
clock-chip (RTC).  (Programming information for the RTC is given later.)
Because the CMOS chip is supplied by a battery, configuration parameters
are saved even during power-off. The chip has 64 registers (00-3FH) read
from port 71H after sending the register index to 70H.  Below are some
register allocations:

When video subsystem is in setup mode (port 94H bit 5=0), VGA responds
to a single option select byte at port 102H and treats the bit 0 as a
sleep bit.  If bit 0 is 0, the VGA does not respond to commands,
addresses, or data.  The VGA responds only to port 102H when in setup
mode. Conversely, VGA ignores address 102H when in the enable mode (94H
bit 5=1).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Port 0A0H: The PC NMI Mask Register
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'Non-Maskable' Interrupt line to the CPU automatically generates an
Int 2 for handling disastrous situations, such as power failure, memory
parity error, math coprocessor error, etc.  On PCs, port at 0A0H is
reserved to hold a mask to disable this line before it reaches the CPU.
Bit 7 set enables the NMI, while bit 7=0 disables it.  On the AT and
PS/2, use port 070H for the same purpose (read port 71H after to clear
the pending read state of the CMOS RAM).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ports 0F0H-0FFH: 80x87 Math Coprocessor
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clear math coprocessor busy signal by sending 0 to port F0H.  Reset
math coprocessor by sending 0 to port F1H.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Port 201H: The Game Port (PC, XT, AT)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Port 201H contains the status of buttons 2,1 of stick B, 2,1 of stick A
in bits 7-4.  Bits 3-0 are set to zero by sending any byte to 201H. The
time it takes for these bits to become 1 determines the Y,X position of
stick B, Y,X position of stick A.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ports 278H-27AH, 378H-37AH, 3BCH-3BEH LPT3,2,1 Printer Ports
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These ports are used on the PC, XT, AT, and PS/2 for parallel devices.
The base port addresses are stored in locations 40:08 to 40:0D.  If the
address value is zero, that port is not available, nor are any which
follow.

The parallel ports have the designations:

     Base port:  Data Output
     Base + 1 :  Status: Reports printer condition and errors
                 Bit   7 0=printer busy (pin 11)
                       6 0=acknowledge data byte received (pin 10)
                       5 1=printer out of paper (pin 12)
                       4 0=printer off line (de-select) (pin 13)
                       3 0=printer error (pin 15)
                     2-0 unused
     Base + 2 :  Control: Initializes adapter and controls output
                 Bit 7-5 unused
                       4 1=printer interrupt enabled (IRQ status)
                       3 0=printer de-selected (inverted pin 17)
                       2 0=initialize port (delay 1/20 second after reset)
                           (pin 16)
                       1 0=no linefeed after CR (pin 14)
                       0 1=output a byte of data - strobe (pin 1)


To test if the printer is on-line, first check the existence of the
printer port starting at 40:08 for LPT1:.  Three parallel port words are
defined.  If a 0 value is encountered, that and further ports do not
exist.  Next, check the printer status byte, bits 3-5.  Do not begin
printing until the status register indicates that the printer is on-line
and ready to receive data.  Monitor bit 7 between each byte of data
sent.

Almost universally, Int 17h is used to control parallel printers.  (This
is in contrast with serial devices, for which direct chip access is
common.)

The following code shows how the printer port can be handled directly
using polling of the status byte:

        MOV DX,BASE_PORT      ; LPTx port address
        LDS SI,DATA_BUFFER    ; characters to send to printer
        MOV CX,DATA_SIZE      ; number of characters to send
NEXT:   LODSB                 ; get character
        OUT DX,AX             ; send it
        INC DX
        INC DX                ; get control register
        MOV AL,00001101B      ; strobe bit set
        OUT DX,AL             ; send strobe signal
        DEC DX                ; get status byte
BUSY:   IN AL,DX              ;  into al
        TEST AL,8             ; test for error
        JZ PRT_ERROR
        TEST AL,80H           ; check for busy
        JZ BUSY
        DEC DX                ; get data port
        LOOP NEXT             ; continue
        ...
Because of the printer, the routine will be slow without print buffering.

An interrupt routine should be avoided with the printer port on the PC
monochrome adaptor, due to a hardware fault.  Instead, use the system
timer to determine the polling frequency.  Interrupt driven routines can
be used on the AT and PS/2.

Ports 2E8-2EEH, 2F8-2FEH, 3E8-3EEH, 3F8-3FEH COM4,3,2,1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 8250 Asynchronous Communication Effector (ACE) is used for control
of the serial ports on the PC.

The AT uses a NS16450, a 16-bit version of the 8250.  The PS/2 uses a
NS16550 which is functionally upward compatible with the NS16450 and the
8250.

The 8250 UART (universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter) converts
parallel data on the CPU's data bus into serial data (50 to 19200 baud)
by dividing the input clock frequency by a programmable 16-bit number.
It occupies seven sequential port addresses.  For the first serial port
on the PC, these are at 3F8-3FFH.  The second serial port occupies
2F8-2FFH.  The following internal registers are set or read by in or out
instructions to the corresponding port offset relative to the first
assigned port value below:

Port offset 7 (e.g. 3FFH) is not used.


If the divisor-latch-access bit is set to 1, then the baud latch divisor
can be read or set byte reading or writing to port 0 (LSB) and port 1
(MSB). The clock signal on the chip at 1.8432 MHz is divided by the
divisor to get the output of the baud generator which is 16x the baud
rate.  Thus the divisors for common baud rates are:

  Baud         Divisor Latch   Decimal
  Rate          MSB     LSB     Value

   300          01      80H     384
  1200          00      60H      96
  2400          00      30H      48
  9600          00      0CH      12
 19200          00      06H       6

Reset bit 7 of the line control register in order to access the data and
other registers.

The Line Control Register:

The word length, number of stop bits, and parity are set with an out to
the line control register.  The first two bits are defined to make a
word length using:

  Bit 1  Bit 0  Word Length

    0      0       5
    0      1       6
    1      0       7
    1      1       8

If bit 2 is 1 when bits 1 and 0 are 00, then 1.5 stop bits are
generated. If bit 3 is 0, no parity will be used and 8 bit data may be
transmitted. If bit 3 is 1 and bit 4 is 0, odd parity is used. If bit 5
is 1 and bit 3 is 1, parity is transmitted as bit 4 indicates, but
received in the opposite state.  Setting bit 6 to 1 forces the output to
logic 0. It remains there until bit 6 is reset.

The Line Status Register:

Bit 0 is set 1 whenever a byte has been received in the receive buffer
register.  It is reset by reading the data or writing to this bit.

Bit 1 is set 1 if an overrun error from the line status register
indicates data in the receive buffer register was not read by the CPU
before another was transferred in.  It is reset by reading the line
status register.

Bit 2 is set 1 if a parity error is detected in the received data.  It
is reset by reading the line status register.

Bit 3 is set 1 if a framing error is detected, i.e. the received
character did not have a valid stop bit.

Bit 4 is set 1 if the received data is held to 0 for longer than a full
word transmission time (start bit + data bits + parity + stop bits).

Bit 5 is set 1 if the transmitter holding register is empty.  It is
reset by loading the transmitter holding register.

Bit 6 is set 1 if the transmitter shift register is empty.  It is reset
by data tranfer to it from the transmitter holding register.


Interrupt Identification Register:

Three bits are used to identify the type of interrupt generated by the
chip. Bit 0 is set 0 if an interrupt is pending.

 Bits 2 and 1 are set as follows:

      1     1   if  a receive line status interrupt occurred
                      (overrun, parity, framing, or break error)
      1     0   if  a receive data interrupt occurred
                      (data ready to be read)
      0     1   if  a transmitter holding empty interrupt occurred
                      (trans. holding reg. just emptied)
      0     0   if  a modem status interrupt occurred
                      (CTS, DSR, RI, or Rec. Line Signal Detect-Carrier)

Modem Control Register:

The Data Terminal Ready line can be made high by a logic 1 to bit 0 of
this register. Similarly, a 1 in bit 1 will set the Request to Send
line to the modem.  The Out 1 line is not used in the IBM PC.  However,
Out 2 must be set to 1 to enable the serial chip to interrupt the CPU
over its interrupt line.

Modem Status Register:

The modem status register indicates the state and changes in the input
lines to the serial port.  The delta bits will be set 1 if the
corresponding lines have changed state since the last read of this
register.  The Receive Line Signal Detect line is also called the
Carrier Detect line (RS-232 pin 8).

Sample Initialization Code:

   MOV BX,3F8H         ; com1 port
   LEA DX,[BX+4]       ; use modem control port
   XOR AL,AL           ; set for all line off (dtr,rts,out1,out2)

(Do not follow one OUT instruction by another on an AT or PS/2.  Use a
delay instruction: JMP $+2 between them.  MOV AH,AL between two OUT
instructions still does not leave enought time for the port hardware to
recover.)

Ports 3B4H and 3D4H: The Motorola 6845 Video CRT Controller Address Register
Ports 3B8H-3BAH and 3D8H-3DAH: The Motorola 6845 Video CRT Control/Status
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 6845 cathode ray tube controller is used on the PC for both
monochrome and color video systems.  The PS/2 VGA system provides some
emulation for both of these controllers at the hardware level.

The 6845 controller uses four I/O ports 3B4H, 3B5H, 3B8H, and 3BAH on
the monochrome card (substitute 'D' for 'B' for color card).

Port 3B4H is the 6845 index register, to which a control register value
of 0 to 17 is sent before a read/write to the data register 3B5H.

The 6845 has 18 control registers, 0-17.  The first ten fix the
horizontal and vertical display parameters.  Incorrect settings of
registers 1-9 can damage a monitor.  Registers 10 and 11 set the shape
of the cursor; 14 and 15 control its location.  Registers 12 and 13 can
handle scrolling. Numbers 16 and 17 report light pen position.
Registers 12-15 are read/write.  Registers 16-17 are read only. All
other registers are write-only.

        6845 Internal Registers:        VGA Emulation and Extension:

R0:  Horizontal total characters        (Total characters less 5)
R1:  Horizontal displayed characters    (Display char./line -1)
R2:  Start Horizontal blanking
R3:  End Horizontal blanking
R4:  Vertical total lines               Start Hor. Retrace Pulse
R5:  Vertical total adjust raster       End Hor. Retrace

   4     Reserved
   3     Video enable
  2-1    Reserved
   0     High resolution mode

Port 3BAH is a CRT read/only status port and a write/only feature
control port on the PS/2.  As a read/only port:

  Bit    Function            PS/2 Extension: Input Status Register 1

  7-6    Reserved            Reserved

  2-1    Reserved            Reserved
   0     Horizontal sync     Display enable (1=hor. or vert. retrace)

As a write/only port on the PS/2, the Write Feature Control Register,
all bits are reserved (bit 3 must be 0).

On the Hercules Graphics Controller, bit 7 may be used to distinguish
a Hercules card from an IMB Monochrome or Color Adapter.  On the
Hercules card, bit 7 goes 0 on vertical retrace (50 Hz).  On the
IBM card, bit 7 does not change.  The Hercules and the Hercules Plus
can be distinguished with bits 4 and 5 (1 and 0 for Plus).

In addition to emulation for the 6845 status, index, and control ports,
the VGA system on the PS/2 uses the ports 3C0H-3CFH for additional video
status information and control.

Each attribute data register is written at 3C0H and read from 3C1H.  To
initialize the address flip-flop, issue IOR to 3BAH or 3DAH.  Then load
the attribute controller register. This toggles the flip-flop for a OUT

Ports 3F0H-3F7H: Diskette Controller Ports
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The PC uses a NEC 765 floppy disk controller.  The PS/2 uses a 8272A
diskettee controller.  The functions and port assignments for the PS/2
and AT are made software compatible with the PC diskette controller.
The 765 controller uses ports 3F2H, 3F4H, and 3F5H, while the 8272 uses
ports 3F0H, 3F1H, 3F2H, 3F4H, 3F5H, and 3F7H.

Ports 3F0H, 3F1H: PS/2 Diskette Status Registers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the PS/2, the ports 3F0H and 3F1H show two of three status registers
used in diskette operations.

Status Register A, at 3F0H, is a read-only register showing:

   0     Motor enable 0

Ports 3F2H, 3F4H, 3F5H: PS/2 8272 Diskette Controller:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Digital Output Register, at 3F2H, is write-only, and used to control
drive motors, drive selection, and feature enable.  All bits are cleared
by a Reset.

  Bit    Function

  7-6    Reserved
   5     Motor enable 1 when select 1 is high
   4     Motor enable 0 when select 0 is high

   0     Drive select (0 = drive 0, 1 = drive 1)


Diskette Drive Controller Status Register, at 3F4H, is read-only, and
used to facilitate the transfer of data between the system
microprocessor and the controller.

  Bit    Function

   7     Request for master (1 = data register ready)
   6     Data I/O direction (1 = from controller to microprocessor)
   5     Non-DMA mode if 1

   1     Drive 1 busy (in seek mode)
   0     Drive 0 busy (in seek mode)

Data Registers for storing data, commands, parameters, and status
information, are accessed from 3F5H.

Port 3F7H is dual purpose on the PS/2:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Digital Input Register at 3F7H is read-only and used to sense the state
of the '-diskette change' signal and the '-high density select' signal:

  Bit    Function

   7     Diskette change
  6-1    Reserved
   0     -High density select

Configuration Control Register at 3F7H is write-only and used to
set the transfer rate.

  Bit    Function
  7-2    Reserved
  1-0    DRC1, DRC0
          00 = 500,000-bit/sec mode
          01 = reserved
          10 = 250,000-bit/sec mode
          11 = reserved

Programming the 765 and 8272 Controllers:

The 765 and 8272 Diskette Controller performs fifteen operations,
including seek, read, and writes.  Each operation is performed in three
phases: the command phase, the execution phase, and the result phase.
The following commands are available:

Read Data
Read Deleted Data
Read a Track
Read ID
Write Data
Write Deleted Data
Format a Track
Scan Equal
Scan Low or Equal
Scan High or Equal
Recalibrate
Sense Interrupt Status
Specify Step and Head Load
Sense Drive Status
Seek


As an example, the read operation follows:

 1. Turn on diskette motor and set delay time for drive to
    come up to speed.
 2. Perform seek opertion.  Wait for completion interrupt.
 3. Initialize DMA chip to move data to memory.
 4. Send read instruction and wait for data-transfer-completion
    interrupt.
 5. Read status information.
 6. Turn off motor.

Operations are performed by sending a command string to the data port
(checking the bit 6 of the status register after each byte).  Interrupt
6 is generated by the controller after a seek operation is complete.
The interrupt handler simply sets bit 7 at 40:3EH, the seek status byte.
Poll this byte until bit 7 is set, then reset the bit and continue with
next sector operation, initialization of the DMA chip.
