===== Stack =====

The memory reference is placed in the Stack Pointer SP.
The system provides a way to relate sequences of push instructions
to each other, by representing the idea of a contiguous address space.
Previously (past) PUSH instructions are then accessible through
the stack pointer. In a sense SP provides a window into the past.
As such it is a tight coupling of memory and instructions, where
a PUSh/POP combination is forgotten. This cannot be traced back,
as the code can have been jumped to from any location within the memory.
When the previous instruction is a CALL, the discontinuation of processing
can be followed as both the reference to its location aswell as the
traces it leaves on the stack are known.

The basic purpose of the stack is to keep track of return addresses.
In this sense, when unpolluted by other values such as arguments,
it can offer a contigous range of potentials.
The topmost potential would be the 'main' program, the initiator
of the first call. Since the purpose of keeping track of addresses
is to be able to know where to return to, which is any program's
ultimate destination, one can simply connect back to the calling tree,
and see what would happen next, at each level.

At each level, there is a local context. Some contexts are empty
as they only use local variables - registers. Some require extra space.
A stack of memory is reserved for this purpose. Each method then
using this system dedicates a register to point to the base of this space,
the base pointer BP.

After entry within a method, this space is reserved by subtracting
the size of the local space from the base pointer. Future allocations
then are made relative to this. Upon exit of this method, the context
has served its purpose, of assisting called contexts. As such the context
serves no more purpse, except to the caller.
The base pointer then needs to be known to the caller.

THis is accomplished by having each method imprint their base pointer
onto the stack. The caller can access this by looking at 'future' values
on the stack - the one that held the return address to it's own
instructoin, and following that, an imprint of the base pointer.
Since the callee can push anything onto the stack at first, it is
convention that each callee returns the base pointer to the value it was
when the method was called. This can be left to the caller to ensure
this functionality - as the value is 'protected' by the return address.
However, the callee has access to the stack regardless,
and as such, cannot be prevented from changing this value.

It can then take into account that callee's can change this value, in order
to receive a result value pointer dynamically, without needing
to know the size of the local stack in advance.


Now, a general approach for this type of local context allocation,
and automatic deallocation upon return, is to interleave the local space
with the calling stack. It can be seen as Object Oriented Programming,
where each method allocates its own 'class data'. Upon exiting the
method, the base pointer is reset to the original value, thus
effectively deallocating the memory.

As such, it can be seen that a method call allocating local space
is identical to merging the constructor and destructor, aswell
as wrapping this within a new / delete or malloc / free.

In order to offer 'method' capability, i.e., expose functionality
operating on this local data, or at the minimum incorporating it,
a return needs to be made after the initialization, and a reference
to the continuation needs to be passed to the caller, in order to
deallocate the object.

Further, a base reference needs to be made available to the caller,
which would have to be supplied to the destructor and possibly other
methods it is exposing.

Now, to then separate the use of BP from the stack allows for local storage
to exist beyond the limitation of a method call,
as normally the stack itself gets overwritten when subsequent calls
are made, whether local storage is allocated or not. One might reserve
a space on the stack then, to only hold return addresses, to a maximum.
This maximum then is the top of the start of the local storage, the initial
value of BP.

An Operating System, since it offers memory and loads programs,
can do away with a lot of protection,
when all programs are compiled to comply to the memory usage consensus.
Thus it can offer a shared space without boundaries where all programs
can interact with each other directly, without each having their own
incompatible use of registers. 

What then ties them together is their promise to return to the address
provided, and extend this ability to their caller, by acknowledging it's
need to know it's return address aswell by preserving the stack pointer
during its lifetime / having been given control / instructions being
executed.

This idea is present within the Terminate and Stay Resident principle.
A TSR would indicate the are of memory to preserve for its functionality.
This it would typically attach to an Interrupt, using a global table of
method pointers. 

In essence then the Interrupt Vector Table is a reflection of Object
Oriented Programming as it displays the concept of 'virtual methods'.

When a method returns, yielding in EBP it's base pointer, in ECX
the amount of contiguous data, it's parent / caller then preserves
this data. When the value returned for EBP equals the one given it,
no memory is preserved.

A program's responsable design then is to provide for the most efficient
handing of ECX being less than the difference of the given and returned
EBP. We can use this as a marker that separates two kinds of data.
The data that would have meaning to the caller, and the data that doesnt,
that is local - public and private data, both of which are obviously
public as the caller knows the address ranges of both.

Now then, we can use the difference of the given EBP, which we'll call
the top of the local heap, and the sum of the returned EBP and ECX,
as the size of an array of records.

The most simple kind of record is a relative offset. This can either
be a code or a data reference. As the beginning of the code is known
to the caller, the addresses can then be taken to be relative to the
code start, or relative to the base pointer of the object
instance data. As such each pointer could be examined for its range,
since when it falls within the given and returned EBP, it references
data. 




malloc:	mov	[esp], ebp	push	ebp
	sub	ebp, eax	sub	ebp, eax
	ret			ret


Fragmentation can occur when calls for malloc do not all share the purpose
of being part of the instance data. The restriction is that the class
data has to be contiguous in memory as only one block of memory is 
remembered for any instance. Thus, the code should first reserve
the space for instance data. When the size of the result is unknown,
such as reading a stream, this would prevent the usage of truly local
stack space. This stack space however, is available on the calling stack.



new:	# caller has to remember it's own ebp
	mov	[ebp], offset destroy # 'push' continuation
	sub	ebp, instance_data_size	# malloc( sizeof( class ) )
	ret

destroy:ret

caller:	push	ebp	
	call	new	# ebp = newInstance(); [[esp]] = destructor
	pop	ebp	# free / delete
	



enterX:	push	ebp
	mov	FRAME_PTR, esp	# FRAME_PTR = internal temp var
	.rept X		# allocate X pointers to X words before BP
	sub	ebp, 4	# ebp is used as argument, local var,
	push	ebp
	.endm
	mov	ebp, FRAME_PTR	# (FRAME_PTR = esp + 4*x) ..and then discarded
	sub	esp, ARG1


Idea: imprint the continuation address on the stack, where the return
address used to be. An instruction like:

	yield	offset contination

	would do:

	IP = Pop();
	Push continuation

so, it is a ret that places a value on the stack, in the place
that is used by the ret itself. It would be useless, to the caller,
to have the address imprinted on the stack, as it either has a hardcoded
reference, or it has this value in a register already.

Thus then the yield instruction would reveal to the caller the address
of the ret/yield.

To simulate this we will have the convention that upon return,
[esp] contains the caller's next instruction - it\'s own continuation -,
wheras [esp - 4] shall contain the continuation of it's children.

The entire stack then becomes the same - addresses above the current
stack pointer refer to continutations of caller processes,
whereas addresses below SP refer to discontinued called processes.

As such, the stack space becomes a horizontal field of potential doorways.

Methods that have finished should have their pointer pointing to the RET
instruction, as this would indicate they effect no change other than
the side effect of imprinting their caller's address on the stack.

This instruction can then be examined to see whether the space is available.

Further, upon calling the continuation, it can change it's base address
pointer, indicating a change in memory allocation.
In a linear system, the instance data of an object can thus never grow,
yet, using paging, this space can be allocated anywhere in memory
and made transparently available to each 'continuation'.


Since it is the caller's responsability to relinquish the pointer,
and thus free it's own declared memory usage, ..


The idea of having ECX to give the upper limit of its data, which would
then potentially leave a space between the top of the heap, and
the bottom - the 'this' pointer - EBP, to contain pointers,
can be done in the code segment aswell, as the meaningful pointers
would either have to be code references / method pointers,
or data references / handle's.  Other types of values can be used,
but they cannot reside in the are above ECX.


Allocate 10 string objects:

	mov	ecx, 10	
0:	call	string
	loop	0b

	# esp = array of string pointers [ebp]
	
string:	sub	ebp, size

yield:	mov	eax, offset cont	push	[esp]
	xchg	eax, [esp]		mov	[esp+2], offset cont
	jmp	[eax]			ret


Now, we can also take [ebp] to be the destructor pointer:

caller:	push	ebp	# store 'this' base pointer: [esp]
	call	string	# ebp = base pointer of string
	call	[ebp]	# [ebp]  = continuation / destructor.

string:	sub	ebp, 4
	mov	[ebp], offset continuation


The pointers could be allocated on the local stack:

new:	push	continuation
	jmp	[esp + 4]

This then leaves the caller with:

	call	new
	call	[esp - 8]
	# [esp - 4] would contain the reference to the constructor.

In this manner, all methods could be defined by pushing their offsets.
A simple lookup table thus would be present in binary code, identified
by a series of PUSH opcodes.

THe result of this is the local stack containing a number of offsets,
which were unknown before the constructor was called. In this sense
this leaves the binary free from any specific format, as for static
functions, the code at the start address can be examined, since
the initialization of these pointers on the stack needs to be done
before the stack could become segmented by other calls.

THe picture of the stack then, from a caller's perspective, after having
called a constructor, is:
	
	[esp + 4] = parent continuation 
	[esp] = this base pointer
	[esp - 4] = constructor of callee
	[esp - 8] = continuation of callee
	[esp - X] = continuation X (method pointers).

It then is the callers responsability to preserve these pointers,
by subtracting a value from ESP before any more calls are made.

A caller would simply deallocate the object with
	pop	ebp



Since these pointers generally are identical, except through polymorphism,
or, having virtual methods - i.e., the constructor may have logic in it
that would yield a different set of pointers depending on it's calling
context (register contents), it is sufficient to call this method once,
or, to discard them on subsequent calls - i.e. to not reserve space
on the stack.

It is then sufficient to only reserve the pointer of the constructor
as an identifier for the class:

	call	new
	sub	esp, 4 + 4 + methods
	call	new
	sub	esp, 4
	call	new
	sub	esp, 4

In order to then traverse this inhomogenous stack, all instances
of the class are sequential. This poses a limitation on the caller
for organizing calls to the same class sequentially, or,
to have all stack images of classes at the beginning. When finding
the class definition of a constructor pointer, traveling the stack,
one might find it's own value repeated, until the last reference
is found. One might have already travelled over method pointers to
other classes, and even class definitions of other classes. It might
even know the base pointers to all these - i.e., the last remembered
offset for each value.


The one register that can be counted upon to remain the same,
even though this can be bypassed, is SP, since it is required
by the caller.

A method's local use of BP then can extend to all callee\'s by proxy,
thus sharing it as a parameter.

Interleaving the stack frame with the base pointer.

	mov	ecx, 10
0:	call	callee
	push	ebp		push	[ebp]	push	[ebp - 8]
	loop	0b
	
callee:	sub	ebp, instance_data_size
	ret
	

The drawback of using

	push	ebp
	mov	ebp, esp
	sub	esp, local_space
	data: [esp]...
	...
	pop	ebp
	ret

is that the push and pop are surrounded by IP on the stack,
and thus a 'ret' cannot be executed with esp the same as when it was
called. The idea here is to skip the 'pop ebp'.

A jump to [esp] in the middle, would offer ebp as the original
value (minus the space on the stack containing the calling address,
and the caller's ebp). i.e.:

new:	push	ebp
	mov	ebp, esp
	sub	esp, localspace
	jmp	[ebp+4]	# ret
continuation:
	pop	ebp
	ret

caller: ebp = BP
	esp = SP
	call	new
	esp = pointer to new's instance data / new\'s base pointer
	ebp = SP - 4
	[ebp] = SP

new's trail: first it leaves the callers base pointer on the stack.
Then it lowers the stack pointer, allocating local space.
THe original SP is returned, minus 4 - it's parent's base pointer.
This leaves esp free for further calls by the parent without interfering
with the instance data on the stack.

The drawback in this is that the order of code execution determines the lifetime
of objects. This then causes fragmenting in the cases where a method
would return an instance of another object, as is the case with
factory methods that may use local space to perform a lookup.
The calling chain would however be preserved in this fashion, for all objects.


Constructing an array of method pointers:

m1:	call m2
	m1 code
	ret

m2:	call m3
	m2 code
	ret

	...

mlast:	mov	[esp -4], 0
	ret

This would mark a chain of method pointers onto the stack. The destructor
itself would have to call one more function, in which case it marks
itself as the last function. The number of functions can be found then
by the caller:

	call	m1
	xor	ecx, ecx
	mov	ebx, esp
0:	sub	ebx, 4	
	inc	ecx
	cmp	ss:[ebx], 0
	jne	0b
	
	ecx = number of methods: (ESP - EBX) >> 2
	[esp - 4] = first function
	ss:[ebx+4] = last function
	ss:[ebx] = pointer to 'free space'
	
In order for a continuation, the offsets need to be incremented
to skip over the 'header', the call instruction:

	cmp	ss:[ebx], 0
	jne	0b

	becomes

	cmp	ss:[ebx], 0
	je	1f
	add	ss:[ebx], 3	# skip over the jump (dyn determine size)
1:	


So, continuations.

Allocation:
	push	ebp	# start of object's data
	call	new
	push	ebp	# end of object's data


new:	sub	ebp, size
	ret
	


old way:

caller:	call	new
	[esp] = offset new
	[esp-4] = old ebp
	ebp = base pointer


new way:

caller:	ebp = FP
	call	new
	[ebp] = offset new
	[ebp - 4] = FP







The caller would then receive results on the stack, which would
be of the same class - code references - as

A class exposing it's code range:

constructor:	call	publish		# push continuation
continuation:

other_methods:	...

publish:	push	end		
		jmp	[esp + 8]	# return to caller of constructor
end:


caller:		call constructor
		# [esp] = constructor
		# [esp-4] = continuation

constructor:	call	yield
continuation:

yield:		jmp	[esp + 4]	# as [esp] is the continuation.

caller:		call constructor
		[esp] = constructor
		[esp - 4] = continuation


2 aspects then:
1) continuation - yielding a code pointer on the stack
2) shared data area management through ebp
	a) using ebp to mark a space on stack, interleaved with code references
	b) having a dedicated memory independent of call stack, yet which
		is operated as a stack.

		# since the parent issued a 'ret', we can do it:
		add	esp, 4 # pop pc, the 'yield' context
		ret

yield:		# [esp] = [cc, pbp, pc, rc]
		jmp	[ebp + pc]	# parent cont


In this way continuations can be 'sneaked in' the parent stack,
so that they are not forgotten on returns.

enter 1
call foo
foo: mov [esp], ..




###########


entry:	[esp] = return address / parent continuation
	ebp = parent base pointer

	push	ebp	# stack: parent BP, parent IP

	# return:
	pop	ebp
	ret

For a yield, the parent would require to have it's ebp restored
when it's code is executed. The yielded method would then need
to convey its base pointer to the parent.

parent:	push	ebp	# save own BP
	call	entry
	# ebp = pointer to entry

entry:	sub ebp, X
	ret

Parent then can deallocate:
	pop	ebp / add ebp, 4

or it can store the reference on the stack for later usage:
	push	ebp
	call	entry
	xchg	ebp, [esp]
	# ebp = own BP
	# [esp] = entry 

It cannot now call other functions as they would overwrite the same space
that is occupied by the called entry.
Thus, each time a method is called, this context needs to be siwtched:

	push	ebp
	xchg	ebp, [esp + 4 + X]
	call	entry_continuation
	pop	ebp

entry_continuation:
	# [esp] = parent continuation
	# [esp + 4] = parent base

####

parent:	push	ebp

	call	entry
	push	ebp
	call	entry
	push	ebp
	# [esp] = [entry 2, entry 1, this]
	# ebp = entry 2




Negative stack: esp - X : lifetime: until next method call. Immediate
returns.


method:	push	ebp	# esp = parent ebp, parent return
	mov	ebp, esp 
	sub	esp, local storage
	sub	ebx, instancedatasize


	mov	esp, ebp # restor start stack
	pop	ebp
	ret


ebp's use here is purely local.


safety_check:
	pushad
	mov	cs:[0f + 2], esp
	call	method
	cmp	esp, 0
	jne	fail

	cmp	ebp, [esp +BP]
	jz	terminated
	jb	resident
	# error
	popad	



	mov	edi, esp
	std
	
	stosd: eax -> [edi--]

############

	# [esp] = return address
	call	function
	# esp may be changed:

function:
	push	continuation
	jmp	[esp + 4]	# ret
continuation:

-->

	mov	ebp, esp
	call	function
	# [esp..ebp] = [continuation, ..., return address]
	# [ebp] = return addresss
	mov	esp, ebp
	ret

Continuation/destructor:

	mov	ebp, esp
	call	function
	# [esp] = continuation
	ret	

continuation:
	add	esp, 4 + bytes allocated in function constructor
	ret	# to [esp] = return address of caller


### general pattern:

parent: push	ebp
	mov	ebp, esp

	# stack: [parent ebp, parent cont]

	# allocate object with lifetime until return
	call	child

	pop	ebp
	ret
##
child:	sub	ebp, localsize
	push	ebp
	# stack now: [child bp, ret(parent continuation)]
	jmp	[esp + 4]
~:	# entered from parent ret
	# ebp = child bp
	# [esp] = [ret/parent cont, parent parent ebp, parent parent cont]
	ret
	# [esp] 


----SP-----	---- BP -----
|A........|	|???????????|	A = parent.cont, bp unknown
				push	ebp
|BA.......|	|...........|	mov	ebp, esp
				# fork
|BA.......|	|BA.........|	call	child		C = [esp]
				C:
|CBA......|	|BA.........|	child:
				push	ebp		C = [esp + 4], 
							C = child.parent.cont
|DCBA.....|	|BA.........|				D = child.parent.base
				sub ebp, sizeof L	# ebp = child.base
|DCBA.....|	|EL..BA.....|
				jmp	[esp + 4]
				C:
|DCBA.....|	|



	push	ebp
	mov	ebp, esp
	call	child
C:	pop	ebp
	ret

no knowledge of child stack play needed. If child leaves esp alone,
the function returns directly. If esp is changed, there is an indirect
return - automatic destructor event chaining on the call stack.

child:	push	ebp	# save parent bp
	sub	ebp, sizeof L
	yield	continuation	# call .+0 ; jmp [esp + 4]
continuation:



yield:	is like a ret, except it doesnt change the stack pointer.
	without base pointers, in a pure calling stack,
	yield = call .+0 ; jmp [esp]

	the call .+0 pushes the next instruction as the continuation.
	The yield then returns and yields the address of the continuation
	on the parent return stack.

Circular Tape - using an angle to index a color. Another resolution
can be added by a second, more precise, indexing, which can be seen
as circular also. 

In this way, the main circular program chan select a resonance, say 6,
of places within it's focus where another 'bubble'/circlular tape expands,
offering another dimension of freedom.

Once this is done once, the principle can be applied to any angle, thus
seemingly creating an infinity of squared freedom.

However, the child circle's center is reflected twice within it's bubble,
appearing as intersections. reflected center is the point shared with
the starting circle.

The places of intersection (vescica pisces) are also the centers of 
the siblings, sharing the parent. Thus 5 brothers/sisters for each
circle on the first ring, aswell as a parent, indicated by the curve
of the siblings.

Ca@i = i: CALL a = push i+1, IP:=a

IP := a =>  set head at => IP@a => JMP a

The first head thus is the Instruction Pointer.


The Second Head is the Stack Pointer: push and pop.

PUSH a :  Wa@SP, (write a at head SP), SP@L, decrement SP


Given a program P with instructions I, it can be reversed-stack-encoded
by constructing a program R that reflects itself partly in the mirror
indicated by SP.

The first instruction pushes the opcode for the last instruction,
and so on.

A simple series of pushes is a straightforward way.
This yields the reflection, in reverse, without the push instructions.

As such the push instruction can serve as 'delayed execution'.

Another encoding is to use the CALL instruction, which pushes
it's succeeding address on the stack. This technique would have to
rely on these calls being made at addresses marking opcode boundaries.

Any calls made may pollute the stack below SP. Having returns then,
would mark the data as obsolete since it is below SP.

Calls can however be used, when the last call would not return.
THis poses the limitation of having always the same sequence of instructions.
A simple interpreter than can be constructed at the end of the stack,
a decoding machine. 

In effect, the end of the stack can be pre-calculated by the software,
so as to line the growing stack precisely up to the end of the code,
so that when the code is done, it simply continues executing on the stack.
Ofcourse, the gap gan be bridged by a jump to the bottom of the stack.
The end of the code then can be the unencoded decryptor, taking the
stack to point to it's argument - the structure pushed on the stack,
representing a program.

When seen in a circle, the program taking the top of stack to be the start
of the program, it then builds its reflected below it and above itself.
It is like a wave emerging from the mirror surface, washing in both
durections - to the right, the location of the program counter,
to the left, the values on the stack, until the waves meet,
at which point the wave reverses direction - seemingly - by now
continuing on in the stack.  At the flip point, the direction bit
is flipped so that the stack works in reverse, thus marking the flipping
point as the beginning of the new program.

Now, the data available on the stack is the original program,
whereas the stack is the original program's output, which had
no data in the stack.

There exists a program that keeps washing to and fro.

There exists a program that keeps washing and that shifts its turning point.

There exists a program that fills itself beyond half a wave, and dampens
the waving radius to contain it entirely within itself.


The second half of the wave - the stack program - can decide to not
turn back when it reaches the initial starting point. 
The stack is set at the beginning of the second wave, so a gap
may be available betweent that and the end of the program, thus
allowing the original program to remain intact.

The simplest program would simply allow itself to be transversed unencumbered,
reaching the beginning of the initial program.

In this manner, a program is a loop which includes its own stack.

Now, lets say that the stack program is an image decoding program.
It can then have data succeeding it, which it decodes and jumps over.

A program that would display a moving sine wave, could have the following
structure:

initial condition: all registers 0. SP = 0 means it is also the end.
The number of the negative bits can be bitmasked by a push
to be within a predefined number.

We'll assume a forward/upward growing stack:


	start:  push jump  # automatic wraparound
		push start

		for angle from 0 to 1
			push plot
			push sin( angle )
		add offset, delta
		jmp SP


Now, to only create the image once:

		for angle from 0 to 1
			push plot
			push sin( angle )
		

		push call	call $+0	plot( ip + 1)
		push sp
		push dec sp	dec sp		plot( [sp-1] )
		push plot	plot( pop )
		push pop	



neuron:	mov	ax, [ sp - 1 ]  # a
	add	ax, [ sp + 0 ]  # bias
	sub	ax, [ sp + 1 ]  # b
	js	[ sp + 2 ]
	jmp	[ sp - 2 ]

ax now represents the neurons output value, so we can simplify
the other neurons:

neuron:	add	ax, [bias]
	sub	ax, [b]
	js	b
	jmp	a


We can then hardcode the two outputs to each neuron in the
instructions. A simple default could be a single string of neurons,
each able to jump, or default to the next neuron:

neuron:	add	ax, [bias]
	sub	ax, [sp + 1] # b
	jns	alternative
b:


The alternative can be an index to another neuron, and can either
be encoded in the instruction, or be read from a table using
an indec.

Using stack values allows then the same neural net to operate
on a 'cloudy gass' of stack.

CPL3 API
========

Paging
------

A page address can be exported to the CPL3 task that is not present.
Calls can be made to 4096 addresses within this page.
When this happens, a #PF is generated. The error code will be the
address, and the flags NotPresent, Read, User, Code:

	mov	eax, [ebp + ERROR_CODE]
	and	al, FLAGS
	cmp	al, FLAG_NP | FLAG_R | FLAG_CODE | FLAG_U

	&&

	mov	eax, dr2
	and	eax, ~4095
	cmp	eax, [task_page_api]

	?

	mov	eax, dr2
	and	eax, 4096
	cmp	eax, MAX_API
	lea	eax, [api_xlat + eax * 4]
	jmp	[eax]

An alternative is to create a jump table using the proper calling
convention. This allows the OS to export the method of invocation:
	near calls,
	far calls,	[gates, task switching]
	exceptions.	[#PF, #GP, interrupts]

The Problem
-----------
The current way to enter kernel mode is to jump to a specific selector,
configured as a gate.
1) one such handler is set up in such a way as to return in CPL0 mode.
   This is intended for use within the kernel at other CPL's, to ask
   for elevation.
   The problem with this approach is that any code anywhere can enter
   kernel mode and execute anything it wants. This is due to the design
   of the handler, which takes explicit care of allowing this by modifying
   the stack, to return to the caller, and trap it's return.
2) All methods that must be callable from CPL3 currently do this.
3) The offset is lost when jumping to a gate.

Solution 1
----------
Retrieve the API address by decompiling the calling instruction.
This may prove tricky, since one can jump to an api using a memory
reference through a register. Or, may use push(x3)/retf, at which point
the stack may have been overwritten - the data will be at [esp - 4],
and any interrupt will overwrite it. A trap gate may disable interrupts.
The stack will have to be made reserved immediately.
Anyway, it's not going to guarantee anything.

After this, use a lookup table to see if the called address is known.

This way, using a call gate, doesn't do a task switch - fastest.

Call gates allow for a stack switch.

The idea is that the API number is encoded in the address, and not pushed
on the stack, nor put in a register, by the calling method.

Solution 2
----------
Parameterized jump table: same as the IRQ table (push API;jmp).


Solution 0: paging
----------
THe only difference between an interrupt gate and a call gate is that
the interrupts are disabled. Both use the TSS for stack elevation.

The paging api doesn't suffer from any of the other problems such as
the caller doing something strange with the stack. Plus, a register (dr2)
will contain the API address called.

Page faults will also become used by other processes, such as file mapping,
disk paging and such. Yet the check for a kernel call API must be done
first. In this way, ALL page faults - representing memory access in a 
region that the kernel did not expose to the task - are seen as an OS
call.

Now it simply becomes a matter of excluding the API page's address range.

There are now also 3 ways of accessing the 4096 addresses in the page.
The first way: to execute at the address. The page itself will only
contain 0. Therefore reading the code could be enabled, in which case
nothing would show.
The second way is to allow reads. This can trigger a 'getter' call.
The third then obviously is to write.

The Call API
------------
	call	API_PAGE + API_NR

	ex_pf_handler:
		[see above]

The read/write API
------------------
	mov	eax, [API_PAGE + API_NR]
	mov	[API_PAGE + API_NR], eax

The downside to this API is that the method of accessing is limited,
because the caller's instruction must be interpreted to find out
in which register to put the value:

	[REP]	LODS 		/ STOS	
	mov	\r32, []	/ mov [], \r32
	push
	inc
	dec
	[any instruction taking a memory reference]

It can be specified that a MOV can only use a register, or eax.

The functionality can be exported, and even used by the kernel to expose
itself.

---
Service Directory
==================

A first place to expose the kernel API must be chosen.

1) int 0x80 	(no arguments)
	out:	eax = service directory descriptor pointer
2) int 0x80	eax = 0
	this suggests an interrupt API. No need for pointers mostly.
3) a fixed memory address.
4) offered in the task when it starts (stack/regs)
	programs that are run, must assume the OS has put values in
	the registers and on the stack.
	In linux and such, a task would call a method to indicate it
	is finished executing. This is nice because it allows the progam
	to abort anywhere without having to keep track of the stack.

	The first convention is what kind of a return: near or far.

	If near: the task knows that the OS is callable from it's own
	code segment.

	If far: the task knows the kernel code selector.
	Two possibilities: a kernel callgate seletor, in which case
	the offsets in the selector are meaningless when used as a call.
	When used as read/write, it can trigger a GP.
	It would require API access to use a far call or a foreign
	selector to access the read/write api.

5) an IO port / PCI.
	This could in a service-oriented design follow the PCI spec.
	The OS could trap the IO PCI access, and return it's own view
	of the system. It could offer fake devices, such as a video
	device, and one that serves as a kernel API.

	The PCI hardware could allow to add virtual devices, but it would
	lose the kernel protection.

	The kernel could allow the program to think that it can access
	PCI. The only and first device returned will be the kernel device.
	The task API then becomes this:

		xor	eax, eax
		out	IO_PCI_ADDR, eax	# 0xcf8
		in	eax, IO_PCI_DATA	# 0xcfc
		# check:
		cmp	eax, VENDOR_ID | DEVICE_ID << 16
		# API detected.
		mov	eax, 8	# class, subclass, prog IF, revision ID
		out	IO_PCI_ADDR, eax
		in	eax, IO_PCI_ADDR
		# ror 16?
		cmp	ax, PCI_CLASS_OS
		shr	eax, 16
		cmp	ax, OS_API_VERSION
		# API version compatible
		# read BAR0 - symbol table, addresses
		# read BAR1 - method availability bitmap / calling conv
		# etc..
	
	Any updates to the PCI space will be unimplemented.

	SUBDEVICES
	----------
	As much as 255 functions are available per device / pci address.
	These could be descriptions for different areas / services,
	such as network, filesystem, media, memory.
	But, these can be better ordered according to version.

	A single device can then export several API's. It can for
	instance, export a Windows api, and a Linux/GNU api.
	This can also be implemented using PCI SUBCLASS ID's - different
	devices.


This allows for a dynamic system.

Then there can be an API convention. These can be declared to belong
to a shared library. The name (path) of this library informs the linker
to treat the symbols in a certain way.
This is already implemented: anything linked against a 'libc' will cause
the methods to be looked up from the kernel symbol table.
This should be modified to allow to specify what methods are callable
from userspace. One way to do this is by declaring labels with a specific
pattern (prefix/suffix).

Such a linker should make use of a more basic kernel api, which exposes
the methods.
Since the kernel exposes the methods to be called, it must also expose
a way for programs to find out about it. In this way programs can be
written to dynamically examine their environment (i.e. generate
a kernel-api library using a simple tool).

To expose this in the linux way using a path or file descriptor is one level
too low, because first the file open method must have been exposed to the
program.


-------
Paging solution, continued
==========================
The kernel API page can be mapped right before the task's code start.



Using 0xb - Segment Not Present
===============================
The idea is to avoid exposing real method offsets, because this allows code to
jump to any address.

Using the Segment Not Present:

	and	[GDT_tss_np + 5], ~ACC_PR
	mov	[TSS_NP + tss_EIP], offset kapi_np

Invoking a call:

	call	SEL_kapi:1

The error code will be the segment, but the offset of the call cannot be
retrieved except by decompiling the calling instruction.


Using 0xd - General Protection Fault
====================================
The same as Segment Not Present. Triggered by setting the limit to 0 or 1.


--


kapi: Current Approach
================
At current, the following happens when an unprivileged task does a kernel call.

It will do a far call to a code selector mapped to a non-present page.
This results in the task being suspended (the TSS selector is set busy
and the TSS register fields are updated), and the TSS for the page fault
handler to be activated.

This means that the page fault handler runs in it's own privileged stack,
in a global TSS. 
Kernel calls generally cause task suspension (WAIT_IO and such).
In order to free the Page fault TSS for other task's calls, the kernel call
must be made in the privileged stack of the calling task.
The page fault handler task will modify the unprivileged calling task's stack
and CS:EIP so that on continuation (an iret in the PF task), the unprivileged
task will continue at kapi_proxy.
kapi_proxy will call a callgate that causes the task's TSS (the global
task-switching TSS that is updated with the privileged stack on each
scheduler's task switch) to become elevated, and thus using it's own
privileged stack. This means that all tasks can do a kernel call and
be suspended.
The callgate will then take care of copying the stack and calling the
kernel method. Upon return to kapi_proxy, it will drop privilege,
clean the stack of the argcount and method pointer, and return after
the task's KAPI_CALL.

This is not efficient: for each kernel call, there are two (hardware)
task switches - in and out of the GP handler - followed by entering
and exiting the callgate, which does a partial taskswitch: it replaces
the code selector and the stack to elevated versions and vice versa.
Thus, each call triggers two full task switches and two partial ones.

It would be more efficient if the calling task would switch to it's 
privileged stack before the page fault handler is called.
This can be done by declaring the page fault handler as an interrupt
gate rather than a task, which means it will use the tasks' elevated
stack - use the current TSS.

Approach: 

	kapi_init: update the IDT to point to a new kapi_pf_isr.

	kapi_pf_isr: will have to do a CR3 switch (CPL0 cs/stack already done).
	No callgate is needed.


KAPI: Call Gates
================

In case of a non-stackarg method, it is possible to not copy parts of the stack,
but simply add another call, which is required as a post-call-handler to restore
the state. The call _could_ be made from the interrupt itself, as it already runs
on the proper stack. However, the interrupt flag is disabled.
Approach for kapi_int32_call_myself:

	sti
	jecxz	1f
	# rep pushd:
	lea	eax, [ecx * 4]
	mov	edi, esp
	lea	esi, [esp + 12] / mov	esi, [esp + 12]
	nop			/ add	[esp + 12], eax	# pop stackargs
	sub	esp, eax
	std
	rep	movsd
	cld
1:	
	mov	(eax|ebx|ecx|esi|edi|ebp), [ebp + STACK_(reg)]
	call	[kapi_ptr + ebx * 4]	# if stackarg, they are popped.

	mov	[esp], offset 1f
	mov	[esp + 4], cs
	iret

1:	retf




	| stackargs |
	| ret cs    |
	| ret eip   |
	---------------------->	| ss
				| esp
	________________________________
	| eflags |
	| SEL	 |     & 3 
	| API	 |


KAPI: Sysenter/Sysexit
======================

This method at current does not yet work, because of the descriptor/selector
layout.
The scheduler must be updated to write the MSR for CPL0 ESP, similar to
updating the TSS ESP0.

Stackarg methods are still somewhat problematic.
