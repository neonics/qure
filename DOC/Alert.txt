System Alerts
=============

Certain system events may require a user intervention.

The console already provides a hook called on printing.
The hook allows to draw a text box on the screen after the screen
is updated, thereby making it a pop-up.

Such a popup would allow the system to continue to operate,
yet prevents shell access by requiring an uncommon keypress to continue.
All other keys are ignored, possibly with sound notification, to
prevent unexpected interruptions in commandline editing causing
answers to be given to the dialog box that were intended for the shell.
By shell is also meant any program run in the shell, which then posesses
top-level screen and keyboard access, besides interrupt handlers and
other tasks that may also invoke the keyboard routines. However,
the alert system is designed for just that, since background routines
are not supposed to interfere with the shell.


kernel/alert.s:

	alert_init: [note|https://github.com/neonics/qure/commit/4ee2deb]
		cmpd	[alert_screen_update], 0; jnz 9f	# protect [screen_update]
		mov	eax, [screen_update]
		mov	[alert_screen_update], eax
		mov	[screen_update], offset alert_show
	9:	ret
	
	alert_message:
		bt	[alert_flags], 1
		jnz	append$
		call	alert_takeover
	append$:
		mov	eax, [alert_messages]
		invokevirtual message append
		jmp	alert_main
	
	alert_show:
		call	drawbuffer$
		call	flushbuffer$
		ret


	alert_release:
		mov	eax, [alert_screen_update]
		mov	[screen_update], eax
		ret
	
	alert_beep:
		call	beep
		load_txt "press <ESC> to continue"
		call	setfeedback$
	
	alert_main:
		call	alert_show
		mov	ah, KB_GET
		call	keyboard
		call	clearfeedback$
		cmp	ax, K_ESC
		jz	alert_beep

The default interrupt handler in ''kernel/idt.s'', which is tightly
connected to the debugger, will check the context of the interrupt.
If the active shell/virtual console caused the exception, the debugger
may proceed as usual (given that the first console is the kernel thread,
as all it's functionality is accessible through interrupts).

If either a background task, or a task attached to another virtual console
caused the interrupt, a popup may be shown indicating the condition
and the program, offering an option to terminate or restart the task,
or to invoke the debugger. Ofcourse, if the exception is a breakpoint,
keys to continue execution with or without switching to the debugger
will be offered. Further, an option to suspend the task (which it already is)
will be presented, allowing to return focus to the current shell
to either continue commandline editing or invoke inspection commands
outside of the debugger. Further, a commandline tool to interact
with the debugger, besides ''int 3'', will offer a way to list such
suspended tasks, and attach the debugger. An option for 'ps' might
filter the task list to show such processes, and a pid option to the
debug command would provide to schedule the task again, which would
invoke the debugger.

When the debugger has been told to suspend debugging the task, it is
marked as nonschedulable in the scheduler, and a flag indicating it's
condition is set. The exception handler will then unroll the stack
up to the point of invoking the exception and yield to the scheduler.

Upon resuming the suspended task, the exception interrupt handler
is invoked again, and it will check the scheduler task context for
the debug flag, in which case it will already have the answer that
the alert would ask for, and proceed to display the debug window.


	kernel/idt.s:

		jmp_table_target:
			...
			mov	eax, [tls_task_idx]
			add	eax, [tasks]
			test	[eax + task_flags], TASK_FLAG_DEBUG
			jnz	debugger

			mov	esi, offset debugger_exception_alert
			call	alert_message
			jz	debugger

			or	[eax + task_flags], TASK_FLAG_DEBUG|TASK_FLAG_SUSPENDED

			popad
			pop	es
			pop	ds
			yield
			jmp	jmp_table_target


The ''debugger_exception_alert'' would point to a static object, or,
a structure containing the text to display, and the options and their
keyboard codes. It further contains a handler for each option. In the
case of a boolean dialog, flags can be set. The unroll/yield code
above could be called in the key handler.s

Also, the unroll is incomplete, as the IP is still pointing to within
the interrupt handler, and, thus occupying the system stack and possibly
other resources if the interrupt is chained. Yet, not all interrupts will
continue execution at the same instruction generating the interrupt.
On the other hand, showing the task as 'stuck' in the debugger is consistent.

The yield will invoke the kernel api through a page fault, thus saving the
flags, and having the scheduler resume another schedulable task with it's
own flags. Thus, interrupts can be left disabled, since the halted task
is not scheduled.


	alert_init:
		sti
		...
		ret

This re-enables the interrupts if they were disabled,
and therefore enables both the scheduler and the keyboard handler, aswell
as any other background activity such as networking. If the exception occurred
in networking, the packet handler task (assuming the network driver has successfully
invoked the routine to append the packet to the incoming queue), which is
invoked by the scheduler using a semaphore indicating the queue size,
will not be schedulable and thus not provide further exceptions. If the
exception occured in an interrupt handler, the exception may occur again,
although the TSS might be marked busy, giving rise to another exception.
