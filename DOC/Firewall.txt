= Kernel Firewall Overview =

These deal only with incoming traffic:

== Ethernet ==

The filtering rules deal with MAC addresses and associated NICs.

[src:kernel/net/net.s#net_handle_packet] rules:
* (DROP) Ethernet subprotocol unknown
* (DROP*) non BCAST/MCAST: RX NIC MAC and packet dst MAC mismatch (*: unless promiscuous mode is enabled)
* (DROP) NIC for eth.dst MAC != RX NIC
* (DROP) no handler for subprotocol


=== IPV4 ===

[src:kernel/net/ipv4.s#net_ipv4_handle] rules:

* (DROP) verify IP header version 4
* (DROP) verify IP header minimum size 
* (DROP) verify IP header size smaller than network packet
* (DROP) verify IP header checksum
* (DROP) non BCAST: verify NIC for dst IP exists (including multicast
  membership)
* (DROP) non BCAST: verify dst IP NIC equals receiving NIC
* (DROP) verify IP subprotocol handler exists
* (DROP) verify if the source IP is routable (usually matches when there's a
  default gateway)
* (ACCEPT)


==== TCP ====

(note: REJECT sends RST)

* (DROP/REJECT) unknown connection and ! SYN   (rest of unknown connection
  rules are for SYN)
* (DROP) unknown connection and ACK
* (DROP) unknown connection and ack_nr != 0
* (DROP/REJECT) no listening socket for dst port
* (ACCEPT)
