The current procedure followed for debugging is:


  Altering DEBUG flags in the source files. They generally have values
  from 0 to 4, where 4 often includes calls to 'more' (pmode)
  or int 0x16 in realmode, which allows to inspect the output before
  it scrolls off the screen (note that realmode scrolling does not remove
  information from the screen, generally, but rather, prints it beyond
  the visible page).


Finding code locations:

    * Exceptions:

    These provide cs:eip and stack information.
    The eip location is printed as both the segment relative (runtime)
    offset) or as the physical address depending on whether pmode was
    entered using a flat code segment.

    * QEMu logging:

    control-alt-2, type 'log in_asm', control-alt-1, wait for the error
    condition. Shift back to control-alt-2 and run 'quit', to make sure
    the logfile is flushed to disk.

    The addresses here are the physical addresses (cs.base + eip).

The memory code offset can be found by several means:

  The kernel load address is the base of cs and can be
  found with the shell command 'gdt', or with 'mem -k -a'.
  It is also printed during kernel boot. However this information
  scrolls out of place, so recompiling with DEBUG set to a higher
  level, enabling keystrokes (see kernel.s), or DEBUG_KERNEL_REALMODE
  (see realmode.s), allows to note the address.

  The load offset depends on the bootloader size aswell as entries
  in the RAMDISK before the kernel image. At current, the kernel
  is the first image, and the bootloader is stable. It does find
  a higher segment aligned to 16kb or so, so that small bootloader
  changes won't change the address.

  At current this address is 0x0011200.


Disassembly

  the alias 'dk' (and 'dk16' for realmode code) provide a disassembly
  of the object file which is based on address 0.

  Translating the runtime (physical) address to the image address is
  done by subtracting the kernel load address, such as:

    perl -e 'printf "%x\n", ADDRESS - 0x11200'

  followed by running 'dk' and searching for the address label.
  The opcodes printed in an exception serve to doublecheck.

  In the disassembly symbols appear, so scrolling up to find the nearest
  label allows to find the proper source.

  The macro 'w' serves to quickly find labels in the kernel source
  to locate the proper file.

  At current the kernel is not relocated to high memory which would allow
  for a load address aligned on a boundary greater than the size of the kernel.

Adding debug statements

  Several macros (DEBUG, DEBUG_DWORD, DEBUG_REGSTORE/REGDIFF, BREAKPOINT)
  are defined which do not generally alter EFLAGS or other registers.

  Since restarting the OS is done within seconds, typing 'DEBUG_DWORD eax'
  in the source file, followed by a save and a history-execution of
  make && qemu, allow for equally fast debugging as can be done with
  an IDE.


Adding shell commands

  Shell commands can be added by simply adding a 'SHELL_COMMAND "foo", cmd_foo'
  to the list in shell.s and implementing the method:  cmd_foo: ret


Detecting memory writes

  At current a shell command must be written with the following invocation:

  mov eax, data_address
  call breakpoint_enable_memwrite_dword

  The data address is typically obtained by adding DEBUG_DWORD [something]
  in the code where this address is set up.

  Typically these kinds of breakpoints are only necessary when there is no
  indication of where the memory is written.



== Bootloader debugging ==

Tools:
	alias hdi - shows hex dump of the boot image.

	util/write.cpp - creates the image, including the ramdisk.

There is a BOOTLOADER_DEBUG flag, where higher values represent more
output and generally more keypresses. Debug levels attempt to accomodate
not losing any information on the screen. However there are more debug
sections available that need to be manually enabled once the location
of the bug has been found and the cause is not clear.
You will note that pretty much all debug code is still present, indicating
past trouble-spots, some of them repeatedly occurring. The ones that
did not occur frequenly are those that need to be manually activated.
