= IDT - Interrupt Descriptor Table = 

== Real Mode: IVT - Interrupt Vector Table ==

Start: Absolute Address 0
Length: 256 * dword = 1024 bytes.
Range: 0000h - 0400h

Items: a vector: realmode segment, offset.

The first 32 (00-1F) vectors are reserved for CPU internal exceptions.

Size and location can be changed (similar to lidt).


== Protected Mode: IDT - Interrupt Desriptor Table.

Item size: 8 bytes interrupt vector.
Contain segment and offset;

Three types:
* Interrupt Gates: suspends interrupt handling when invoked
* Trap Gate: no interrupt suspension.
* Task Gate: switch current TSS (Task State Segment).


Load into the IDT register (IDTR) using lidt.

= IRQ =
Master PIC: IO Port 0x20, 0x21 (Command, Data) IRQ 0..7 => map 0..7 realmode
0: timer
1: keyboard
2: cascade from IRQ8-15
3: COM2/COM4
4: COM1/COM3
5: LPT2
6: floppy disk
7: LPT1

Slave PIC: IO Port 0xa0, 0xa1 (Command, Data) IRQ 0..8 => map IRQ 8..15 realmode
8: realtime clock timer
9: free: use for peripherals (legacy; scsi host adapter etc)
10: free: scsi / nic
11: idem
12: PS2 Mouse
13: FPU / inter processor interrupt
14: primary ATA (IDE)
15: secondary ATA (IDE)

Interrupt vector offset for Master PIC: 8. Resulting INT: 8..15 (8 + IRQ).
Interrupt vector offset for Slave PIC: 70h. Resulting INT: 70h..77h.

== PIC ==

The 8259A Programmable Interrupt Controller.

D7..D0 : data bits
A7..A0 : INTA pulse data values

How it triggers the CPU: Interrupt Sequence Outputs

It generates 3 INTA pulses (an output bit on the chip).
During each pulse the CPU reads the byte at the data port.
During the first pulse the opcode for the INT instruction (0xcd, 11001101)
appears on the data buffer.

During the second pulse, the lower address of the ISR is programmed
on the data bus.
When interval (a config bit) is 4, A7..A5 are programmed, A4..A0 automatic.
When interval is 8, A7,A6 are programmed, A0..A5 are automatic.

During the third pulse, the higher address (programmed as byte 2
of the initialization sequence) is enabled.
